## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5


### What I learned

I learned how to work with Bootsrap cards to produce the final product. I also furthered my understanding on div's and how they work.
Here is a snipped of code I'm proud of; CSS used to create the background design:

```css
#bg-image{
  position: relative;
  top: -10px;
  left: 50%;
  right: 50%;
  margin: 0 -50vw;
  width: 100vw;
	max-width: 100vw;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I am going to continue to practice with margin and padding to develop a better understanding.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com) - Great resource if ever you get stuck with your code.
